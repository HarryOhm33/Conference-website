            The 1st International Conference on Mechanical & Industrial
            Technologies (IC-MIT 2025) is going to be held in the Department of
            Mechanical Engineering, MIT Muzaffarpur, Bihar India during May
            24-25, 2025. The conference will offer an international forum for
            researchers, academics, scientists, professional technologists, and
            industry experts to present and disseminate their research, studies,
            contributions, advancements, and innovative concepts pertinent to
            Mechanical Engineering. The program will include invited
            presentations, regular sessions of contributed papers, and keynote
            addresses on a variety of topics by distinguished experts in their
            fields. Aspiring authors are asked to contribute novel works that
            are not currently being submitted elsewhere. Each article will be
            blind subject to peer review, with acceptance criteria considering
            quality, originality, technical content, and significance.
